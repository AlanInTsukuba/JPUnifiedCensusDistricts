Description: This project will create an aggregate set of census districts that 
    covers Japanese census districts at the community level for multiple census 
    years. The basic idea is that while Japanese municipalities merged extensively 
    in the early 2000s and continue to merge, community (cho-oaza) have remained 
    largely unchanged. However, there have been many small boundary changes. Also, 
    some exurban developments have produced more extensive changes. This project 
    takes the naive approach of using shapefiles to determine overlaps and merging 
    districts that overlap more than 1% in either direction. It will cover 
    census years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and possibly 2020. It will also cover 
    economic census years 2009 and 2014.
