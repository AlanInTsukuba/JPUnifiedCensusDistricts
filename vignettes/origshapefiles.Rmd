This package includes shapefiles for local census districts in Ibaraki Prefecture covering 
    the six censuses. These as well as shapefiles for all prefectures can also be downloaded from 
    [e-Stat](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/gis/statmap-search?page=1&type=2&aggregateUnitForBoundary=A&toukeiCode=00200521).

The original shapefiles are in kmz format wrapped in a zip file. The first task is to extract and 
    convert these to geojson. 

Copies of the original files for Ibaraki Prefecture are in extdata.
```{r}
list.files(system.file("extdata",package="jpucd"))
```
